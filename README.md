# GoIt-react-hw-02-feedback

## Description

This project is a simple feedback collection application built with React. It allows users to provide feedback by clicking on different feedback options: good, neutral, or bad. The application keeps track of the feedback statistics, including the total count of feedback and the percentage of positive feedback. It's a great exercise for learning how to manage state in React and handle user interactions.
